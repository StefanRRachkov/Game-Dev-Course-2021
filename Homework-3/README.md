Tasks:
 1. Unit Tests - 1) When your player is hit, to lose life 2) When you jump on a spring to change the player's Y position 
 2. Controller support
 3. Procedurally generated levels - You can have one level as an introductory level and after that all levels will be generated.  
 4. Multi-player:
   <br/>4.1. Sync movement and animations
   <br/>4.2. Distinct players by showing players' names above their heads like "Player1", "Player2", etc.
   <br/>4.3. Make a winning condition like who gets first to the top or the first to get a key
   <br/>4.4. Show all players who is the winner
 5. Juice - Whatever you want, minimum 2 effects (Blood, Camera Shake etc) check Game Feel 
 6. A way to kill your enemies - By picking a powerup like in Pac-Man, by shooting projectiles at them, the choice is yours
