Tasks:
 1. Unit Tests - 1) When your player is hit, to lose life 2) When you jump on a spring to change the player's Y position 
 2. Controller support
 3. Procedurally generated levels - You can have one level as an introductory level and after that all levels will be generated.  
 4. Multi-player ***BONUS*** - We will discuss it on 8th of May. Two players racing to the top or for limited time who will get most keys or something like that.
 5. Juice - Whatever you want, minimum 2 effects (Blood, Camera Shake etc) check Game Feel 
 6. A way to kill your enemies - By picking a powerup like in Pac-Man, by shooting projectiles at them, the choice is yours
 
 ***For the task it's recommended to use your project from practice and not the one from this repository!***
